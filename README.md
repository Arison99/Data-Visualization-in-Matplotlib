It's recommended to use a virtual environment for managing dependencies. You can create one using:

```bash
python -m venv env
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows: `env\Scripts\activate`
- On macOS/Linux: `source env/bin/activate`

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the data visualization scripts, simply run them with Python:
